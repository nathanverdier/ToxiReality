# ToxiReality

Welcome on ToxiReality !

This is the documentation of the Hololens part of the project.

For some obvious reasons of very numerous files in a unity project, I will only put on this repo the `Assets/Scripts` files.

You will also find a guide to recreate the project. It is not really complicated once all the scripts and MRTK3 are installed, don't worry :)
